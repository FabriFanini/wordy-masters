# Wordy Master 

Welcome to **Wordy Master**, a challenging and fun word-guessing game inspired by the popular *Wordle*. This project was developed as part of my learning journey with **Front End Master Academy**, combining web development skills with interactive design.

In **Wordy Master**, players must guess the word of the day within a limited number of attempts. Each guess provides valuable hints to help players get closer to the solution, making the game both engaging and educational.

## Features

- Daily word challenges.
- Intuitive and responsive user interface.
- Color feedback to guide your guesses:
  - ðŸŸ© Green: Correct letter and position.
  - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: Correct letter, wrong position.
  - â¬œ Grey: Incorrect letter.

## Technologies Used

- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## How to Play

1. Guess the word in a limited number of attempts.
2. Enter a word, and see the feedback based on your guess:
   - ðŸŸ© A green tile means the letter is correct and in the correct position.
   - ðŸŸ¨ A yellow tile means the letter is correct but in the wrong position.
   - â¬œ A grey tile means the letter is not in the word.
